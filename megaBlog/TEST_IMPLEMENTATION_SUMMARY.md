### 3. E2E Tests (Cypress)
Created comprehensive E2E tests in `cypress/e2e/image-functionality.cy.js`:

#### Create Post Flow
- ✅ Complete form submission with image
- ✅ Verify navigation to post page
- ✅ Check card preview on home page
- ✅ Validate form requirements (image required)

#### Edit Post Flow
- ✅ Load existing post data
- ✅ Replace image and verify old image deletion
- ✅ Update without changing image
- ✅ Verify changes across all views

#### Delete Post Flow
- ✅ Delete post and verify removal
- ✅ Confirm image file cleanup from bucket
- ✅ Check post card disappears from home page
- ✅ Handle deletion errors gracefully

#### Image Validation & UX
- ✅ Accept only valid image file types
- ✅ Handle large file uploads appropriately
- ✅ Display loading states during operations
- ✅ Maintain image aspect ratios in different contexts

### 4. Test Infrastructure
- ✅ **Custom Cypress Commands**: Login, create post, verify images, cleanup
- ✅ **Mock Setup**: Appwrite service, React Router, Redux store
- ✅ **Test Fixtures**: Sample images and test data
- ✅ **Test Scripts**: NPM scripts for different test scenarios

### 5. Test Automation & Reporting
- ✅ **Test Runner Script**: `test-runner.js` with colored output and reporting
- ✅ **Coverage Reports**: Jest coverage configuration
- ✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with usage instructions

## 🧪 Test Scenarios Verified

### Scenario 1: Create New Post with Image
```
✅ User uploads image → ✅ Post created → ✅ Card shows preview → ✅ Individual page displays image
```

### Scenario 2: Edit Post and Replace Image
```
✅ User selects new image → ✅ Old image deleted → ✅ New image uploaded → ✅ All views show new image
```

### Scenario 3: Delete Post
```
✅ User deletes post → ✅ Post removed from database → ✅ Image deleted from bucket → ✅ Card disappears
```

## 🚀 How to Run Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies (already done)
npm install

# Run unit tests
npm run test

# Run unit tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run E2E tests (requires dev server)
npm run dev  # In one terminal
npm run test:e2e  # In another terminal

# Run all tests
npm run test:all
```

### Using Test Runner
```bash
# Check usage
node test-runner.js --help

# Run unit tests only
node test-runner.js

# Run unit + E2E tests
node test-runner.js --e2e

# Run everything with reporting
node test-runner.js --all
```

## 🎯 Test Coverage Areas

### Unit Test Coverage
- ✅ Component rendering and props
- ✅ User interactions (form submission, file upload)
- ✅ API service calls and mocking
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases
- ✅ State management during operations

### E2E Test Coverage
- ✅ Complete user workflows
- ✅ Cross-page navigation and state persistence
- ✅ File upload and download functionality
- ✅ Visual verification of images
- ✅ Error states and recovery

### Performance & UX Testing

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Mocking Strategy
- **Appwrite Service**: All methods mocked with realistic responses
- **React Router**: Navigation and params mocked
- **Redux Store**: Authenticated user state provided
- **File API**: Custom File class for upload testing

### Test Data Management
- **Consistent test data** across unit and E2E tests
- **Cleanup utilities** to prevent test pollution
- **Fixture management** for reliable test assets

### Error Simulation
- **Network failures** during image upload/download

4. **Review coverage reports** regularly to identify gaps

### For CI/CD
1. **Integrate into GitHub Actions** or similar CI pipeline
2. **Require passing tests** before merging PRs
3. **Generate and store test reports** for trend analysis
4. **Set up automated notifications** for test failures

### For Monitoring
1. **Track test execution times** to identify performance issues
2. **Monitor flaky tests** and improve reliability
3. **Collect metrics** on test coverage and success rates
4. **Regular review** of test effectiveness and relevance

## ✨ Summary

This comprehensive testing implementation covers all three required scenarios:

1. **✅ Create new post with image** → verify card preview and individual page image
2. **✅ Edit post and replace image** → old image deleted, new one shown everywhere  
3. **✅ Delete post** → image file removed from bucket, card disappears

The testing suite provides both **unit-level validation** with Jest and **end-to-end verification** with Cypress, ensuring the image functionality works correctly at all levels of the application.
